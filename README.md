# odin-recipes

1. This is the start to creating a website from what I have learned this far
   from the Odin Project and hopefully later on we can continue to style the website.

2. Started on creating the website by adding in the inde.html webpage file where it shows the links for the recipes. Each link redirects to a webpage to another tab
that shows the recipe and instructions on how to create this recipe. Created the recipe html files under the recipe folder and also created it for the beef burger, cheese pizza, and beef lasagna.
